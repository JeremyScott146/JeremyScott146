## Hello! 
I'm a front-end web developer & student at ASU in the final year of a GIT-Full Stack Web Dev undergrad degree.
  <br> Outside of programming, I enjoy music production and photography (checkout my IG).
  - I'm currently learning Java and SQL
  - I'm currently working on an ecomm site 🤓

If you've got an interesting project I'd love to collab!
